### 👋 Hi there! I'm Vibhuti

I'm a Computer Science graduate with a strong passion for Data Science and AI. After completing an Executive Post Graduate Program in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence (March 2025), I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in the same domain with a specialization in Deep Learning.

I enjoy building machine learning and deep learning models that solve meaningful problems — from gesture recognition to AI assistants — and I’m continuously learning and exploring the evolving world of AI.
